How Companies Are Cutting Zendesk Storage Costs by 90% While Keeping Every Attachment Accessible

---

### *A deep dive into how Attachment Storage Offload transforms Zendesk for growing support teams*

For many businesses, Zendesk is the backbone of customer support. It’s where conversations happen, where teams collaborate, and where customer history lives. But as ticket volume increases and files accumulate, one thing becomes painfully clear: **Zendesk’s native storage is expensive. Very expensive**.

Images, PDFs, invoices, videos, product photos, logs, and diagnostic files all quietly eat up your included storage limit. Suddenly, you’re paying for 25 GB excees storage blocks, even if you're only a few megabytes over! Storage charges climb. Finance starts asking questions. Zendesk admins scramble to delete old files that may have future value.

This isn’t a rare problem. It’s one nearly every scaling support team eventually faces.

This is why our **Attachment Storage Offload** solution was created.

# **The Hidden Cost Problem in Zendesk: Why Storage Spikes Are Inevitable**

It doesn’t matter how efficient your support operation is, if your business handles attachments, the math is unavoidable:

* Over time, **ticket volume increases**
* With scale, **attachment size and frequency increase**
* Support agents need to **retain context**, so deleting files isn’t an option
* Zendesk charges for **blocks**, not actual usage

And the bigger the business grows, the more dramatic the jump.

Most companies only discover the problem when:

* finance notices an unexpected line item,
* Zendesk notifies them they’re approaching the limit, or
* ticket loading slows because of large embedded attachments.

The recurring complaint is always the same:

> “We don’t mind paying for Zendesk. We mind paying through the nose for Zendesk's mandated storage.”

# **A Simple Idea That Changed Everything: Keep Every Attachment, Store It Elsewhere**

**Attachment Storage Offload** solves the storage problem at the root.

Instead of storing attachments inside Zendesk’s expensive, block-based storage, the system automatically:

1. **Offloads attachments to cheaper external storage**
2. **Retains secure access to them** from every Zendesk ticket
3. **Makes the entire process invisible to agents**

Support teams keep the full attachment history. Zendesk stays fast and lightweight. Storage bills drop dramatically.

It feels like magic, but it’s all automation and architecture.

# **How the Offload Pipeline Works (Behind the Scenes)**

### **Step 1 — Connect Your Zendesk**

Authorize the app in a few clicks. No engineering work. No API configuration. No downtime.

### **Step 2 — Choose What to Offload**

You can set rules such as:

* Ticket age
* Attachment size
* File type
* Total amounts to offload

This ensures your most recent or mission-critical attachments stay local if needed, while the rest are moved automatically.

### **Step 3 — Automated Secure Transfer**

Files are:

* Copied to your chosen storage
* Encrypted in transit and at rest
* Removed from Zendesk safely
* Replaced with seamless sidebar access

Your tickets remain fully intact. Your history stays complete.

### **Step 4 — Access Attachments Like Normal**

Agents view offloaded attachments directly inside a sidebar app on the ticket.

No new tools. No new tabs. No loss of context. No training required.
