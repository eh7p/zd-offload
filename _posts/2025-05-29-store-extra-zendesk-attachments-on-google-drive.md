Ever wanted to store your customers Zendesk attachments and files on Google Drive instead of inside very expensive Zendesk excess storage? Now you can!

---

As your company grows, so does your customer service, and with that, your Zendesk Storage demands. Once you exceed your Zendesk Storage allowance, you can be charged up to $60 for each 25GB block of additional storage, coming out to an extortionate rate of $2.4/GB. On top of that, even if you are only using 1GB over you need to pay for a full 25GB block of storage!

There are multiple ways to save on these fees, but our favourite is the [Zendesk Attachment Storage Offload](https://eh7p.com/zd-offload/) solution. The solution aims to be as transparent and frictionless as possible, replicating Zendesk storage as closely as possible. While other solutions can delete or export attachments, the offload solution moves attachments into external storage, but through the sidebar app agents can continue to view and access those offloaded attachments!

# Extract to Google Drive

You can easily connect up your Google Drive to be used as the storage backend for the Zendesk Storage Offload solution. 

The first step is link your account to your Google Drive. Next, identify and link the desired final storage destination. Now the extracted attachments will be stored on your Google Drive account for long term storage and retrieval.

We seamlessly and securely connect between your Zendesk account, our processing servers, and your Google Drive account, offloading attachments from Zendesk into your Google Drive, and retrieving and displaying those attachments when requested through our sidebar app in the Zendesk interface.
